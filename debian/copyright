This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of Graham Barr
<Graham.Barr@tiuk.ti.com>'s libnet.  This is a set of perl modules
which provide easy exploitation of several common Internet protocols.

Michael Alan Dorman <mdorman@debian.org> put together this package
from original libnet sources.  The library is available from the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN). Visit
<URL:http://www.perl.com/CPAN/> to find a CPAN site near you.

The only change for the Debian package was the addition of the debian/
files.
